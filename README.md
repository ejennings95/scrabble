# Scrabble

When learning the basics of programming a common learning challenge is working out the value of a letter in scrabble.

Wanting to practice Javascript and JQuery, I took this basic challenge and included some of the more complex rules of the game.

This was a personal project I spiked for fun. This means there is a severe lack of testing (in other words, none). Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of the small webapp and decided to add it to Github.

#### Requirements

My aim for this, as mentioned was to practice with specific tech. I set the functionality to be:

* A responsive website
* To have a live track of the word and score
* The ability to include the rules:
  * Double letter score
  * Triple letter score
  * Double word score
  * Triple word score
  * This includes the ability to land on more than one special word tile

#### Run the program

To run this you need to:

- Clone the repo
- Run 'node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server'
- Run the suggested link in your terminal such as:
  - Available on:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8080
    - http://192.168.1.227:8080
